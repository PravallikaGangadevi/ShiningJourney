		<h2>Welcome to my digital haven!</h2>
		</i>
		<br>
		<i>
		<p>I'm Pravallika(aka Shiny), a final-year Computer Science Engineering student at Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology and Sciences, on the brink of an exciting new chapter. Amidst the whirlwind of academia, I've embarked on an extraordinary journey in parallel – pursuing a BS degree in Data Science from IIT Madras through online learning.</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://anits.edu.in/" ><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eS36IpEMTak/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:300px;height:250px;"></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

		</p>
		<br>
		<p>This unique dual pursuit reflects my insatiable appetite for knowledge. My foundational year journeyed through the intricate corridors of Data Science, and now I'm navigating the exhilarating path of the diploma phase. The amalgamation of technical precision and analytical curiosity defines my academic odyssey.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As I tread the realms of Web Technologies, I've discovered the art of crafting digital spaces. This realization kindled a spark within me – the desire to encapsulate memories and milestones on the internet canvas. The result is this website, a tapestry where I weave moments and musings into the digital threads, preserving them for posterity.</p>
		<br>
		<p>With each line of code, I'm etching memories, insights, and triumphs. This space serves as a memoir of my learning journey – from the intricate algorithms that challenged me to the triumphant "Eureka!" moments. It's not just a repository of self-expression; it's a conduit to share my growth with you.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Join me in this virtual gallery, where I showcase not just certificates and accomplishments, but the essence of my metamorphosis. As I balance the realms of coding and data, I'm also embracing the art of storytelling through code and design. Your presence here honors my effort to capture time in pixels.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So, as the lines of code align and stories unfold, I extend an invitation – to explore, connect, and share in the chronicles of my transformation. Let's transcend the virtual walls and embark on a journey where memories are immortalized, lessons are learned, and aspirations are etched onto the tapestry of the internet.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Welcome to my world, where technology marries memories, and where every click is a step into a memory lane crafted in HTML and dreams.</p>
